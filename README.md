# BUILDING WITH RESPONSIVE DESIGN

## [Collaborative Project]

~ This project consists of building a responsive website. We cloned [The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/), a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

You can find the original project specification [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-responsive-design)
